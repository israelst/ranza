# Ranza

> The npm's butler

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/express.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/ranza)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/raphamorim/ranza.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/raphamorim/ranza)

Quickly spot any dependency required in the project and not listed in `package.json`. And also the other way around: quickly remove listed dependencies that are being used.

Run whenever you need or use the `watch` command to install dependencies automatically as you write `require`s on your project.

A simple **status** example:

![Ranza Status](docs/images/status.png)

## Install

With [node](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) installed, install ranza with a single command:

```sh
$ npm install -g ranza
```

## Usage

#### Status

Checks all project for required dependencies and confirms if they are listed on `package.json`:

```sh
$ ranza status
```

You can use status with debug option as arguments, to best view requires status showing the occurrence files, ex:

**input:**

```sh
$ ranza status --debug
```

**some output example:**

```sh
Defined and used:
  • babel-core
     => lib/new.js

  • bluebird
     => core/src/comparer.js
     => core/src/manager.js
     => core/src/sentinel.js

Defined, but unused:
  • grunt
  • babel
```

#### Install

Installs all dependencies required throughout the project, but do not save them in `package.json`:

```sh
$ ranza install
```

Installs all dependencies required throughout the project and add them to `package.json` as `dependencies`:

```sh
$ ranza install --save
```

Installs all dependencies required throughout the project and save them in `package.json` as `devDependencies`:

```sh
$ ranza install --save-dev
```

#### Clean

Remove and clean all unused dependencies from `package.json`:

```sh
$ ranza clean
```

#### Watch (only for HARDCORE developers)

**The not recommended way:**

> Installs every single dependencies in each livereload

Livereload in all files, installing undefined dependencies without saving them in `package.json`:

```sh
$ ranza watch
```

**The recommended way:**

> Installs only missed dependencies in each livereload

Livereload in all files, installing undefined dependencies and saving them as `dependencies` in `package.json`:

```sh
$ ranza watch --save
```

Livereload in all files, installing undefined dependencies and saving them as `devDependencies` in `package.json`:

```sh
$ ranza watch --save-dev
```
